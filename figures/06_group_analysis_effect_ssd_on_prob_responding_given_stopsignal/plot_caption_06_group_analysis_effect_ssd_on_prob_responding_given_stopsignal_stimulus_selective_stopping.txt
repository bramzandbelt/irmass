Probability of responding on stimulus-selective stop trials as a function of stop-signal delay. Data points represent observed probabilities, lines represent predicted probabilities by the Bayesian logistic regression model. Transparent points and lines are participant-level data, opaque lines are group-averages. Participant-level data points are offset and jittered horizontally to improve visibility.
