Support for and against the independent race model for action- and stimulus-selective stopping under lenient and more stringent Bayes factor criteria. Each panel shows the percentage of participants providing support for or against the independent race model for the different types of selective stopping (rows) and independent race model predictions (columns), under lenient Bayes factor criteria (left; $B_{01} < 1$ means support for the independent race model, $B_{01} > 1$ means support against the independent race model) or more stringent criteria (right; $B_{01} < 1/3$ means support for the independent race model, $B_{01} > 3$ means support against the independent race model, $1/3 > B_{01} > 3$ means inconclusive evidence).
