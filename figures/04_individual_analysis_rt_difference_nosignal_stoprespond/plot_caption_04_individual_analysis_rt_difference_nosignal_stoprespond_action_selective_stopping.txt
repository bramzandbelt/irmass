Response times on action-selective stop-respond trials and no-signal trials. Each panel shows data from one participant, including (i) response time distirbutions on individual stop-respond trials and no-signal trials, displayed as violin scatter plots (each asterisk is a trial); (ii) mean response time across trials, indicated by white, filled circles; (iii) the Bayes factor quantifying the evidence for $H_0$ vs $H_1$ ($B_{01}$), indicated by the panel background color; (iv) the subject identifier, indicated by the number in the top-right corner. Panels are ordered by $B_{01}$ (descending order).
