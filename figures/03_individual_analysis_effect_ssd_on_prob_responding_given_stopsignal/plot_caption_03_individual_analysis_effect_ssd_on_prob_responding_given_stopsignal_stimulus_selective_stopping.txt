Probability of responding bimanually given a stimulus-selective stop-signal as a function of stop-signal delay. Each panel shows data from one participant, including (i) the observed response probability as a function of stop-signal delay, indicated by open circles; (ii) the predicted response probability as a function of stop-signal delay, indicated by a black, solid line; (iii) the Bayes factor quantifying the evidence for $H_0$ vs $H_1$ ($B_{01}$), indicated by the number in the bottom-right corner of each panel as well as the panel background color; (iv) the subject identifier, indicated by the number in the bottom-right corner. Panels are ordered by $B_{01}$ (descending order).
